## ðŸŽ® Overview
**Dig Deeper** is a **2D Tower Defense Exploration** game created by **Oblivion Owls Inc**.  

You play as a member of an excavation crew whose vehicle has broken down. Armed with only a single light and your tools, you must traverse the depths in search of a powerful enough generator to get you home. But youâ€™re not alone down thereâ€”the deeper you go, the more questions remain unanswered.

Built in our **custom game engine**.
